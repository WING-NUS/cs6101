_Credits: Much of the architecture for this course project comes from
Bryan Low (NUS) and Thorsten Joachims (Cornell)_

A key part of the mastery of machine learning is practicing it,
outside of the formal mathematical and statistical basis for the
algorithms.  The **student projects** form an integral part of the
assessment.  Student teams should have 5-6 members and will be
assembled by the teaching staff.  There are two kinds of projects that
can be done: _Self-Defined Projects_ and _Kaggle Competition
Projects_. **Choose only one of the two**.

### Self-Defined Projects

The final project is intended to be a limited investigation in an area
of machine learning of your choice. The purpose of the project is to
enable you to study an area of your interest in greater detail in a
practical way. The project can take on many forms, including but not
limited to:

* Projects that explore the application of machine learning ideas to an interesting “real-world” problem.
* Projects that involve a theoretical or empirical study of aspects of a learning method or model.
* Projects that do an experimental, comparative study of various machine learning methods.
* Projects that extend or synergise with an existing project (could be from a member of your group), such as a honors year project. <em>Caution: this type project may lead to unequal contribution, due to members’ prior expertise.</em>

Doing such a project gives you more flexibility and allows you work on
something of your liking. However at the same time, this may
potentially require some additional effort (depending on your problem)
such as data collection or coming up with suitable baselines, and/or
explicitly declaring what is being extended or novel for the scope
proposed for the class.  The teaching staff will take these factors
into account when grading.

### Kaggle Competition Projects

On the [Kaggle](http://kaggle.com) website, you can find and choose
from a number of interesting machine learning competitions. Upon
joining a competition, you will be provided with a training and
testing sets, and your performance will be measured with specified
metrics and ranked with other competitors on the web.

Note that performance on the different metrics is not the critical
factor in your grade on the project. While doing well on the
competition helps, we primarily evaluate with respect to the
(interesting) ideas your team employs to solve the task.  While the
data is easier to obtain for such a project, there is less flexibility
and more emphasis on coming up with interesting methods.

You will need to form teams and propose a topic to for your project in
a formal project proposal.  The staff and your peers will give you
feedback.  After the project proposal, you will be assigned a contact
TA that you can use as a resource for questions and advice.

In Weeks 8-9, the staff will meet with all teams for the only
mandatory consultation.  Your team will need to prepare a short
presentation deck to present to the staff about the progress of your
project.  Based on your team’s interest and the staff’s opinion on
your project, you may elect to present at 17th STePS.  Teams that
present at STePS will have a slightly different path and grading
rubric for their project which involves additional consultation with
staff and cumulates with a public presentation at STePS.

Detailed grading rubrics for all phases of the project are provided as
part of the project reporting templates provided in class, as well as
through the accompanying project videos that are released on Week 1.
The general grading metrics are as follows:

* Originality
* Relevance to course
* Quality of arguments (are claims supported, how convincing are the arguments you bring forward)
* Clarity (how clearly are goals and achievements presented)
* Scope/Size (in proportion to size of group)
* Significance (are the questions you are asking interesting)

As with supervised machine learning, sometimes it’s easier to learn from
data than from rubrics.  You can get a look at past projects by
looking the previous iterations of
CS3244 projects as housed in SoC's STePS platform, from either
[Semester I, AY 19/20](https://isteps.comp.nus.edu.sg/event/15th-steps/module/CS3244) or
[Semester I, AY 18/19](https://isteps.comp.nus.edu.sg/event/13th-steps/module/CS3244).
