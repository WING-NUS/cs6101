WING.NUS's CS6101 lab section will be conducted as a public course, with class participants nominating themselves and presenting the materials and leading the discussion.  In Semester I of AY2025/2026, we will focus on the topics of

**Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**.

<!-- This course is based on materials from Percy Liang, Tatsunori Hashimoto and Christopher RÃ©'s [CS324 Large Language Models](https://stanford-cs324.github.io/winter2022/) course at Stanford; Danqi Chen's [COS 597G Understanding Large Language Models](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall22/cos597G/) course at Princeton; and Ryan Cotterell's [Large Language Models](https://rycolab.io/classes/llm-s23/) course at ETH.  All three sets of instructors have given their explicit permission to allow us to re-use and build upon their fantastic resources.  There will be 14 reading sessions, which will be held from 16:00 pm to 18:00 pm on Fridays. On alternate Thursdays, 13:00-15:00 pm, we will have project consultation sessions. -->

**Discussion Group**. <a href="http://cs6101.slack.com/">A mandatory discussion group is on Slack</a>. Students and guests, please login when you are free. If you have a @comp.nus.edu.sg, @u.nus.edu, @nus.edu.sg, @a-star.edu.sg, @dsi.a-star.edu.sg or @i2r.a-star.edu.sg. email address you can create your Slack account for the group discussion without needing an invite.

If you need an invite to the Slack group.  The Slack group is being reused from previous semesters.  Once you are in the Slack group, you can consider yourself registered for the group.

It is not a lecture-oriented course and not as in-depth as the original source courses we are drawing from (with explicit permission).  Hence, our course is not a replacement, but rather a class to spur local interest in the topics of large language models.

Please see the detailed schedule in the table.

## Schedule  {#schedule}

The sessions will be broadcast live via the customized Zoom link as advertised on the [Slack group](http://cs6101.slack.com).  For semi-privacy reasons, the group meeting ID and access is not publicly disseminated here on the webpage.

**The schedule below is preliminary (last updated 3rd July 2023.)** We may make slight changes on the allocation for topics and provide alternative suggestions for papers.
