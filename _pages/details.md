* **Postgraduates**: This reading group also can count towards credit for NUS SoC students.  For NUS SoC doctoral students, this is a section of **CS 6101 Exploration of Computer Science Research**. CS 6101 is a 4 unit pass/fail module for new incoming doctoral students to obtain background in an area with an instructor’s support. It is designed as a "lab rotation" to familiarize students with the methods and ways of research in a particular research area.  As CS6101, it is offered in Session I (Weeks 3-7) and Session II (Weeks 8-13), although it is clear that the course is logically a single course that builds on the first half. Nevertheless, the material should be introductory and should be understandable given some prior study.  Note that the class starts a bit before either lab rotation session.  You are expected to review the prior materials on your own before your first session and contact Min if you have any queries. 

* **Undergraduates**: With AI advancing rapidly and having (fairly) new foundations featuring mostly linear algebra, much of current cutting edge research is also achievable and understandable for advanced undergraduates.  For this reason, we also invite self-selected undergraduate students to formally enrol in this course for 2 or 4 units (differences to be discussed in the first intro lecture) as [Design Your Own Course](https://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/academic-information-policies/undergraduate-students/design-your-own-course) (DYOC), Option B, hosted by the [School of Computing](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg), [Web, IR / NLP Group (WING)](http://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg). Min does not organise the group leader for the group application, so students taking this option will need to self-organise.

* **For interested public participants**: Please send Min an email at ```kanmy@comp.nus.edu.sg``` to join the course and to secure a Slack invite. We do not offer credit or certification for completion of this course, as we view this as an unpaid service to the NLP/AI/LLM community.  External parties opting to participate are greatly encouraged to NUS physically to participate in the lecture concurrently with all of our local participants. You are also welcome to participate online through Zoom. We typically have a synchronous broadcast to Zoom that is streamed and (after review) archived to YouTube.  During the session where you’re responsible for co-lecturing, you will be expected to come to the class in person to help give the class.

As an external participant, you **are** obligated to complete the course to best your ability, for **all 14 weeks**. We disencourage students who are not committed to completing the course to enrol; for casual learners, we encourage you to use the source materials that will be available afterwards on the main or sub pages and on YouTube or suitable video archives.
